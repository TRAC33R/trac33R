#1. Calculate what each line in calculate_me.csv evaluates to. The only operators are +, -, and *! There is no /. 
#What is the average of all the final values?
'''
Average =  529.91
'''

#2. Explain how a stack is used to evaluate postfix notation.
'''
Since in postfix notation you need to utilize only the first two numbers you have on hand,
you use a stack to store and access numbers in that order.

For example, if you had a list [3, 4, 10, +, 6, *, -],
The code would read it like:
[3]
[3, 4]
[3, 4, 10]
[3, 4 + 10] = [3, 14]
[3, 14, 6]
[3, 14 * 6] = [3, 84]
[3 - 84] = [-81]

The operator would only be applied when it's encountered in the list to the
last two numbers in the list, or rather the top two numbers on the Stack.

# what methods you tried, what worked or didnâ€™t work, what could have gone better, and what you learned during this lab.
