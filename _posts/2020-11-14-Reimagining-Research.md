### Find a study of your own that interests you, and imagine a world where that research has advanced and come to some definite conclusions. Then, write a blog post that answers the following questions (same as classwork worksheet)

##### *Relationships between video-gaming habits, parental monitoring and school performance*

**1. Identify a statistical question that you could ask.**
- Would this sort of control on the child negatively impair their overall happiness?

**2. Identify the population you would study to answer the question. What information about the population would help answer your question?**
- Kids 12-16
- How much they play in general, in addition to how many and how much their friends play, and if they tend to play together frequently or not

**3. Identify a feasible sample frame, and explain your reasoning.**
- 3 different grades within a school
- Choose this to cover a wider range of students while at the same time keeping the sample size small enough

**4. Identify the sampling method you would use, and explain your reasoning. What makes this method better than the others?**
- Convenience sampling
- This would be best as it would allow us to get as many people as possible to be included within the experiment so as to not miss / exclude anyone

**5. Suppose you had the means to run an experiment on this sample. Identify the null and alternative hypotheses.**
- Null: Control does not negatively impair a child's overall happiness, this method seems to work (for now)
- Alternative: Control does affect child’s overall happiness, and should attempt another method of downing child’s per hour gaming

**6. Identify the variables and treatments that would provide information about your question. Explain your choice of treatments.**
- Independent
    - Extent of control of parent on hours played gaming by Child
- Dependent
    - Overall Happiness of the Child
- Treatments
    - No control of Parent over Child
    - 1 Hour Control
    - 3 Hours Control
    - 5 Hours Control
    - No Video Gaming


**7. Identify the treatment groups, and how each subject would be assigned to a group.**
- Treatment Groups
    - No control of Parent over Child
    - 1 Hour Control
    - 3 Hours Control
    - 5 Hours Control
    - No Video Gaming
- Subjects would be first divided up into groups based off of how much they play on average, and then they would be random assigned to one of these treatment groups
    - Play on average groups:
        - 0-2 Hours
        - 3-5 Hours
        - Greater than 5 Hours

**8. Briefly discuss how the experiment would be conducted.**
- The experiment would be conducted over a school and would run over a month during the school year. Then afterwards, surveys would be taken from both the parents and the students on how things went, along with a 1-10 Scale of how the parents and the children felt over the month.

**9. What biases may come up, and how would you address them?**
- Only covers one school / school district area
    - Would address by having this performed in multiple schools in various different areas
