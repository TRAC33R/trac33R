Worked on with Anthony White

This lab was fairly difficult in how many details had to be considered in what could be seen as simple steps.

I referred to the code I original coded from the previous assignment which checks for the species and petal-widths associated with each of those items, and placing all of the widths
into a separate list. Then it takes that list, treats it as one long string, then converts into a dictionary format, with the species as the "key" and list associated with that species
as the "value".

The code was pretty similar to what I needed to do for this assignment, so I implemented a lot of the code from before. 
First I changed all of the value holder's names in order to differentiate what was necessary.
