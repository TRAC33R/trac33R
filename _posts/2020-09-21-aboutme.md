###Prior Experience with Computer Science
Before taking Art of Data, as a kid I always messed around with computers since I had nothing else to do. I fixed computers, phones, and various other devices 
in my free time. Eventually I started taking some classes in school, joined the Robotics team, and now here I am. I'm currently in the process of completing
my Google IT Tech Support Certificate.

###Something I like
As a hobby, I enjoy playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate for the Nintendo Switch with friends. It's a lot of fun and yet also competitive, and everyone gets a 
blast playing together during our free periods together.

###Looking forward to this year
I'm looking forward to being able to hang out with friends in person this year, for however long that'll be. It's be awesome the last couple of days so I can't
wait to see how the future goes.
