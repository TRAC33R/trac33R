*The Science of Emotional Intelligence*
By Peter Salovey and Daisy Grewal, *Yale University*

## 1. Analyze and question the data that the scientists use.
- "ABSTRACT - This article provides an overview of current
 research on emotional intelligence. Although it has been
 defined in many ways, we focus on the four-branch model
 by Mayer and Salovey (1997), which characterizes emo
 tional intelligence as a set of four related abilities: perceiving, using, understanding, and managing emotions.
 The theory provides a useful framework for studying in
 dividual differences in abilities related to processing emotional information. Despite measurement obstacles, the
 evidence in favor of emotional intelligence is accumulating. Emotional intelligence predicts success in important domains, among them personal and work relationships." (281)
    - Four Branch Model
        - Perceiving
            - "ability to detect and decipher emotions in faces, pictures, voices and cultural artifacts." (281)
            - Also includes ability to identify personal emotions as well
        - Using (Emotions)
            - Ability to use emotions to do certain brain tasks such as thinking and problem solving (281)
            - "The emotionally intelligent person can capitalize fully upon his or her changing moods in order to best fit the task at hand." (281)
                - That just sounds like focusing? Needs bases but interesting idea though
        - Understanding
            - "ability to comprehend emotion language and to appreciate complicated relationships among emotiongs." (281)
                - Also includes ability to see how emotions can evolve / change over time
        - Managing Emotions
            - "ability to regulate emotions in both ourselves and in others." (282)
    - Measurement Obstacles
        - What measurement obstacles? and how does that make the evidence "in favor" of emotional intelligence
    - EQ Predicts success in important domains --> personal and work relationships
        - Makes sense but how is that proven? And what other domains?

- Says within text that "The concept has received considerable media attention, and many readers of this article may have already encountered one or more definitions of emotional intelligence." (281)
    - Must consider the fact that there has been much attention received already, and therefore results may be skewed just to satisfy people's belief and interest

- Goal of introducing idea of emotional intelligence was "to address a growing need in psychology for a framework to organize the study of individual differences in abilities related to emotion." (281)
    - Is essentially saying that they needed a way to frame and categorize someone's ability to communicate and understand, as psychology is based around that rather than their intelligence on its own
        - Essentially felt that intelligence on its own did not include the entirety of that area
        - intelligence does not mean emotionally intellgent?
    - "has been show to have an effect on important life outcomes such as forming satisfying personal relationships and achieving success at work." (281)
        - How has it been shown? Seems like it fixes these things, but in reality it is probably a part of the whole that makes good personal relationships and success at work

- "Our conceptualization therefore defines emotional intelligence as a set of skills or competenencies rather than personal traits." (282)
    - Learned rather than posseses? Not totally sure about this, need more information

- "For example, positive emotions can temporarily broaden a person's repertoire of thoughts, leading to creative problem solving (Frederickson, 1998)." (282)
    -  Says but does not provide credence to this research / could be faulty previous research to be based off of

### TESTING
- Mayor-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT)
    - Made because needed to address "whether people are sufficiently aware of their own emotional abilities to report upon them accurately, and whether people answer the questions truthfully instead of reporting in a socially desirable manner." (282)
        - Addresses a previous test's failures --> failures to address in this test as well?

- MSCEIT
    - 40-minute test
    - Tests four branches individually along with a total score
    - Scored in a consensus fashion
        "higher scores indicating higher overlap between an individual's answers and those provided by a worldwide sample of thousands of respondents." (282)
        - This helps mitigate issues of false answers, but using a worldwide sample might still mean a majority lied / false data to base off of
    - Can also be Expert Scored
        - Overlap is calculated between individual and 21 emotional researchers
            - What is an "emotional researcher" and how does that make it good data? (?)
    - Both methods are reliable and present similar results
        - Says this but is not proving this / just an assertion
    
    - "However, not only does the MSCEIT appear to test emotional abilities rather than personality traits, it also does not correlate with scales that measure a person's likelihood to respond in socially desireable ways." (283)
        - Says here that the data is not skewed by false answers as all the data required is not biased
            - Is this true though / can it be trusted?
            - Perhaps trying to make reader think it is all acredited when in fact it may not be

    - Study of relationship between emotional intelligence and antisocial behavior
        - "Males who scored lowed on the MSCEIT reported engaging in more recreational drug use and consuming more alcohol. In addition, these participants reported having more unsatisfying relationships with their friends." (283)
            - Does say that they accounted for participants personality and analytric intelligence
                - Does not provide hard data, hard to say
    - Says that students who scored higher on the test received more positive ratings from friends
        - In addition, students who had higher scores were more likely to give emotional support if need be
            - Not hard to infer information, but this can be shown a supported assumption
    - People were asked to keep diaries of social interactions, and those who scored higher on the MSCEIT said they had better success in interacting with the opposite gender
        - More likely to report that they came off as attractive and the other found them as intelligent / friendly
            - Who is the other though, are they reporting as well? Or is this just inferred or what, a little strange

    - Higher scores on MSCEIT were related to better reports from colleagues, easier to work with, positive work environment, more representative, socially sensitive, tolerant, greater potential for leadership



## 2. Analyze their results. Do you trust their findings? Why or why not?
I trust their conclusions as they make sense to me as well. It mostly seems like they're making a conclusion that can easily inferred but are just supplementing those ideas with extra data. So I do trust their "findings" but a lot of their supplemental data I am more skeptical of. For example, a lot of their data is arbitrary in the sense that they refer to other research papers but do not really talk about the proof behind their assertions nor the other papers. They also tried to say many times that their results were not skewed, but they would not totally back that up with hard facts, making one question the bias behind these assertions as well. In general though I do trust their findings, even though there could be "more information / hard data" to back these assertions up.

## 3. How might "publish or perish" have affected this study?
The idea of "publish or perish" could have led to the lack of hard data in this paper, in addition to the making simple assertions that can easily be said rather than going for more out there but in depth assertions as the need to have a "safe" answer which can be accepted by the public. In addition, the idea of Emotional Intelligence already existed, so the wish to back up that idea was out there more than an assertion or explanation against it. For instance there were no counterarguments addressed in the essay, and there were many places where they tried to say that their data was on point and not skewed to make their paper as legitimate as possible. So while this paper does most likely contain good assertions, it's a "safe" paper rather than an intellectually stimulating / potentionally wrong assertive paper.
